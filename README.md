This is a project that I completed during a GitHub course on Coursera offered by IBM. 

A calculator that calculates simple interest given principal, annual rate of interest and time period in years.

Input:
   p, principal amount
   t, time period in years
   r, annual rate of interest
Output
   simple interest = p*t*r
